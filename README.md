DeSaM
=====

The Decentralized Sanitation Model (DeSaM) was originaly developed and
implemented in R by Thomas Hug.

This is a reimplementation of DeSaM from scratch in
Julia, a ``high-level, high-performance
dynamic programming language for technical computing''.

The aim of the reimplementation is not to reproduce all features of
the R version but rather provide a well designed basic structure that
can be extended easily by the user.
