\section{Introductions}

The Decentralized Sanitation Model (DeSaM) was originaly developed and
implemented in \textsl{R} by Thomas Hug. 

However, the \textsl{R} implementation is very slow and software
design is somewhat flawed. This makes bug-fixing and implementation of new
features almost impossible. Therefore, DeSaM was reimplemented
from scratch in \href{http://julialang.org/}{Julia}, a ``high-level,
high-performance dynamic programming language for technical
computing''.

The aim of the reimplementation is not to reproduce all features of
the \textsl{R} version but rather provide a well designed basic structure that can be
extended easily by the user.

% ============================================
\section{Design}

A DeSaM simulation consist only of interacting \texttt{Tank}
objects. The tanks are arranged in a tree like structure. A tank can
be filled either directly by a source (e.g.\ a household) or by
collecting from upstream tanks.


% ---------------------------------
\subsection{Tanks}

Each \texttt{Tank} object (see Figure~\ref{fig:tank}) is defined by
its maximal volume, the initial costs, a source function, a collection
function, and, if existing, a vector of parent \texttt{Tank}
objects. Direct upstream tanks that are emptied in a tank are referred
as ``parent tanks''. A tank has tree state variables that are updated
over time: the tank volume, the overflow volume, and the costs.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/tank.pdf}
  \caption{Structure of a \texttt{Tank} object.}
  \label{fig:tank}
\end{figure}


The type definition shows all fields\footnote{A ``field'' is an element
  of a composit type, e.g. \texttt{V\_max}. The expected type of a
  field is indicated after the ``\texttt{::}''~operator.} of a tank
objetcs in detail:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
type Tank

    ## tank properties
    V_max::Float64

    ## State variables
    V::Float64
    V_overflow::Float64
    costs::Float64
    time::Int

    ## function for sources, takes 'time' as argument
    ## and returns (volume, costs)
    source::Function

    ## function for collection, takes 'parent tanks' and 'time' as arguments
    ## and returns (volume, costs)
    collection::Function

    ## a vector of elements of type 'tank'
    has_parents::Bool
    parents::Vector{Tank}

end
\end{verbatim}
}


Three functions are available to create \texttt{Tank} objects:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
Tank(V_max::Real, source::Function, costs::Real)
Tank(V_max::Real, parents::Vector, collection::Function, costs::Real)
Tank(V_max::Real, parents::Vector, collection::Function, source::Function, costs::Real)
\end{verbatim}
}
The first option is used when a tank has no parents and no
collection. The second function is typically used for the collection
tanks. The last function defines a tank that serves as collection tank
and has a direct source at the same time.

Initial costs of the tank \emph{and}, if needed, of the
collection are defined by \texttt{costs}.

The behavior of a tank is largely influenced by its source and
collection functions.  In most cases the user will provide these
functions. However, some basic functions are implemented that can be
modified or used directly. 


\subsubsection{source function}
The source function can be any function that takes as argument
\texttt{time} and returns a tuple with the daily volume that goes in
the tank and the daily costs.

A very simple source function could be: 
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
function simple_source(time)
    ## produced volume of all household members
    V = rand()*10 # U(0, 10)
    ## costs
    costs = 0.1*V
    return(V, costs)
end
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{collection function}
The collection function can be any function that takes as argument a
vector of \texttt{Tank} objects and \texttt{time}. It must return a
tuple with the daily collected volume and the daily costs.
\textbf{The function must also change the volume of each parent tank
  that is emptied!}

A minimalistic example: 
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
function simple_collection(tanks::Vector{Tank}, time)
    V_coll_max = 200.0
    n_tanks_max = 10
    n_tanks = size(tanks,1)

    ## tanks are emptied the same order
    V_coll = 0.0
    for i in 1:min(n_tanks, n_tanks_max)
        V_tank_out = min(tanks[i].V, V_coll_max - V_coll)
        tanks[i].V -= V_tank_out   # !!! change volume of parent tank !!!
        V_coll += V_tank_out     
    end

    ## costs
    costs = 10.0 + 0.2*V_coll

    return(V_coll, costs)
end
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Simulation}

After defining a network of tanks the simulation can be performed. This
is done by updating the \emph{last tank} via \texttt{update()}.
\texttt{update()} makes use of the recursive structure and updates all
upstream (parent) tanks  automatically.

A minimal example of a simulation:{\small
\begin{verbatim}
t_sim_max = 365
for t in 1:t_sim_max
    ## update final tank
    update(tank_final)             
end
\end{verbatim}
}

Typically, on is interested how some state variables evolve over
time. A more realistic example where every day the total overflow
volume of the household tanks is stored (the function \texttt{push!(A, e)} adds
element \texttt{e} to the end of array \texttt{A}): {\small
\begin{verbatim}
## define an empty vector to store results
Volumes_overflow_households = Float64[]   # type must be given

t_sim_max = 365
for t in 1:t_sim_max
    ## update final tank
    update(tank_final)   

    ## compute sum of all overflows
    V_overflow = sum(get_field_of_parent_tanks(tank_final, 1, :V_overflow)) 
    ## save every time step
    push!(Volumes_overflow_households, V_overflow) 
          
end
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Limitations of the design}

The chosen design enables a very elegant and fast implementation in
Julia. So is the core functionality implemented with less than 150 lines
of code. Most missing features should be easy to add. However, there
are intrinsic limitation of the design (not sure how far they apply to the
\textsl{R} version, too):

\begin{itemize}
\item The collections cannot be organized ``globally'' because they
  depend only on the tanks to empty and the time.
\item Multiple substances could be implemented, however, different
  collecting routes for different substances are not possible
\item Only tree like systems can be simulated. Also distribution is not
  possible, i.e. to transport volume to several child tanks.
\end{itemize}

%\citet{le_gat_2009} said that \citep[e.g.][]{le_gat_2009}.
